> Spatial priotization of conservation management effort

Optimization framework for spatial allocation of conservation management effort.

This package contains the data and R code to perform prioritization of conservation management effort. 

Please contact l.cattarino@imperial.ac.uk or pull a request on this github project if you have any queries.

## Installation
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LorenzoCattarino/priorityeffort")
```

## Description

The `analysis` directory contains the script for running two prioritization experiments described in the article:
* Species targets are linearly scaled to each species' area of occupancy (Experiment 1)
* Species targets are the same for each species and the actual target value is varied (Experiment 2) 

The `analysis` directory contains also the scripts for post-processing the experiment results and generating the figures shown in the article and in the supporting information. Post-processing scripts assume that you had previosuly run the simulation experiments yourself, as experiments results have not been made available in this repository, due to file size limits.
